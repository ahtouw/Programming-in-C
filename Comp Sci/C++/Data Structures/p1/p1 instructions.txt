Write a C++ program that:

1) defines a tPS type (transformPrimeStack) that is much like a regular stack but

a) stores only transformed versions of odd prime numbers
     if odd prime number ‘x’ is pushed, the (‘previous prime’ -1) is stored

          5, 11, 17, 23, 29, …  pushed => 2, 6, 12, 18, 22, …  stored

          1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9 ,..              would not be stored

b) doubles in size automatically if storage space exceeded
2) tests this tPS type on integer data

          Reads in integer data from P1Input.txt file

          Stores all unique integers, LIFO, in tPS object. 

3) dumps tPS object contents to output file called P1Output.txt
