Write a C++ program that:

1) constructs an ordered linked list to store integer values

stores only transformed versions of odd prime numbers

     if odd prime number ‘x’ is pushed, the (‘previous prime’ -1) is stored

            5, 11, 17, 23, 29, …  pushed => 2, 6, 12, 18, 22, …  stored

            1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9 ,..                      would not be stored

2) defines routines to:

traverse the linked list
insert an element into the linked list
delete an element from the linked list
 

3) tests the routines using a random number generator
