Write a C++ program that:

1) defines a primeDupBST type (class) that:

provides all the capabilities of a standard BST
search, insert, and remove

is a well-designed C++ class
copying is handled appropriately
constructor and destructor defined and implemented
implements recursive inorder traversal
implements an ITERATIVE preorder traversal
does not store duplicates of non-prime numbers
stores ‘duplicates’ of PRIME numbers using a count field
increment count upon insertion
decrement count upon deletion
remove element if count goes to zero
2) uses a driver to test this primeDupBST type on integer data

initial construction via random number generator
arbitrarily insert and remove values
dump preorder traversal to output file “P3out.txt”
dump inorder traversal to output file “P3out.txt”
